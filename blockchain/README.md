## Key Features

### Digital Asset Tokenization

The platform uses ERC-721 and ERC-1155 standards to tokenize digital assets:

- Each digital asset is represented as a non-fungible token (NFT)
- Asset metadata is stored using IPFS for decentralized storage
- Ownership is verifiable and transferable on the blockchain
- Fractional ownership for shared digital assets is supported

### Inheritance Smart Contracts

The smart contract system automates the inheritance process:

- Time-locked inheritance contracts
- Multi-signature verification requirements
- Condition-based asset transfer
- Staged release of digital assets
- Revocable and updatable inheritance instructions

### Death Verification Oracles

Secure verification mechanisms to trigger inheritance contracts:

- Multi-source death certificate verification
- Trusted oracle networks for verification
- Fallback verification mechanisms
- Cool-down periods to prevent false triggers
- Manual override options for designated trustees

## Contract Deployment

To deploy the contracts to various networks:

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Compile contracts
npx truffle compile

# Deploy to local development blockchain
npx truffle migrate --network development

# Deploy to testnet
npx truffle migrate --network goerli

# Deploy to mainnet (requires proper configuration)
npx truffle migrate --network mainnet
```

## Testing

To run the test suite:

```bash
# Run all tests
npx truffle test

# Run specific test file
npx truffle test ./test/unit/DigitalAssetToken.test.js

# Run tests with coverage report
npx truffle run coverage
```

## Smart Contract Security

Our blockchain implementation follows strict security practices:

- Formal verification of critical contracts
- Comprehensive test coverage
- External security audits
- Rate limiting and circuit breakers
- Upgradable contract patterns
- Secure multi-signature requirements

## Gas Optimization

Contracts are optimized for gas efficiency:

- Batch operations for multiple assets
- Storage optimization patterns
- Gas-efficient inheritance structures
- Layer 2 solutions for high-volume operations
- Proxy contracts for upgradability

## Private Blockchain Option

For enterprise deployments, a private blockchain configuration is available:

- Hyperledger Fabric implementation
- Permissioned network setup
- Custom consensus mechanisms
- Private transaction support
- Enterprise access control integration

## Legal Compliance

Smart contracts are designed with legal requirements in mind:

- Jurisdictional flexibility for different legal systems
- Digital signature compliance
- Legal backup documentation generation
- Regulatory reporting capabilities
- Emergency intervention mechanisms
