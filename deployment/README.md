## Deployment Options

### Local Development

For local development and testing:

```bash
# Start development environment with Docker Compose
cd docker/compose
docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up

# Run with local Kubernetes (requires minikube or kind)
cd kubernetes
kubectl apply -k overlays/development
```

### Cloud Deployment

The platform supports deployment to major cloud providers:

#### AWS Deployment

```bash
# Initialize Terraform for AWS
cd terraform/environments/aws
terraform init

# Plan and apply infrastructure
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan

# Deploy application with Helm
cd kubernetes/charts
helm install digital-heritage-platform ./digital-heritage -f values-aws.yaml
```

#### Google Cloud Platform

```bash
# Initialize Terraform for GCP
cd terraform/environments/gcp
terraform init

# Plan and apply infrastructure
terraform plan -out=tfplan
terraform apply tfplan

# Deploy application with Helm
cd kubernetes/charts
helm install digital-heritage-platform ./digital-heritage -f values-gcp.yaml
```

### On-Premises Deployment

For enterprise on-premises deployment:

```bash
# Generate configuration
./scripts/generate-config.sh --environment=on-prem

# Deploy to on-premises Kubernetes cluster
cd kubernetes
kubectl apply -k overlays/on-premises
```

## CI/CD Pipeline

Continuous integration and deployment workflows are defined in:

- `.github/workflows/` - GitHub Actions workflows
- `deployment/jenkins/` - Jenkins pipeline definitions

The pipeline includes:

1. Automated testing
2. Security scanning
3. Docker image building
4. Infrastructure validation
5. Deployment to staging
6. Automated and manual testing in staging
7. Promotion to production

## Scaling and High Availability

The platform is designed for high availability and horizontal scaling:

- Stateless application components
- Database clustering and replication
- Auto-scaling configurations
- Multi-region deployment options
- Disaster recovery procedures

## Security Configurations

Deployment includes security hardening:

- Network policies and security groups
- Secret management (using Kubernetes Secrets, Vault, etc.)
- TLS configuration for all endpoints
- Security scanning in CI/CD pipeline
- Compliance reporting tools

## Monitoring and Observability

The deployment includes comprehensive monitoring:

- Prometheus for metrics collection
- Grafana dashboards for visualization
- ELK/EFK stack for log management
- Distributed tracing with Jaeger
- Alerting and notification setup

## Backup and Disaster Recovery

Automatic backup and disaster recovery procedures:

- Database backup schedules
- Blockchain state backups
- Point-in-time recovery options
- Geo-replicated storage
- Recovery testing automation

## Performance Tuning

Environment-specific performance configurations:

- Resource allocation recommendations
- Caching strategies
- Database indexing and optimization
- Load balancing configurations
- Content delivery network (CDN) setup
