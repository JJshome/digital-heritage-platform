## Key Features

### Asset Classification and Tagging

The platform uses deep learning models to automatically classify and tag various types of digital assets:

- Document classification (personal, financial, legal, etc.)
- Image content recognition and scene understanding
- Sentiment analysis of text content
- Importance rating prediction based on content and metadata

### Memory Narrative Generation

AI models help organize digital assets into meaningful narratives:

- Timeline construction from chronological data
- Theme detection across multiple assets
- Relationship mapping between people and events
- Contextual understanding of life events

### Personalization and Recommendations

The recommendation system creates personalized experiences:

- Memorial space layout recommendations
- Content highlight suggestions
- Customized privacy recommendations
- Inheritance suggestion engine

## Model Training

To train or fine-tune the AI models:

```bash
# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Train the asset classifier
python training/scripts/train_asset_classifier.py --data_path=../data/virtual/assets --epochs=50

# Train the sentiment analyzer
python training/scripts/train_sentiment_analyzer.py --data_path=../data/virtual/messages --epochs=30

# Run a complete training pipeline
python training/scripts/run_pipeline.py --config=configs/full_pipeline.yaml
```

## Inference Service

To run the AI inference service:

```bash
# Start the inference server
python inference/server.py --port=5000 --models=asset_classifier,sentiment_analyzer

# Test an endpoint
curl -X POST http://localhost:5000/api/classify \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"content": "Important financial document", "metadata": {"created": "2023-05-01"}}'
```

## Model Versioning and Deployment

AI models are versioned and deployed through a structured pipeline:

1. Experiment tracking with MLflow
2. Model versioning with Git LFS
3. CI/CD integration for automated testing
4. Containerized deployment with Docker
5. Model registry for version management

## Ethics and Privacy

Our AI implementation adheres to strict ethical guidelines:

- Privacy-preserving machine learning techniques
- Federated learning where applicable
- Transparency in model decisions
- Fairness and bias mitigation measures
- User control over AI features
